# Internship-Project-NYC-Bicycle-Riders-Data-Prediction
Context:-

The New York City Department of Transportation collects daily data about the number of bicycles going over bridges in New York City. This data is used to measure bike utilization as a part of transportation planning. This dataset is a daily record of the number of bicycles crossing into or out of Manhattan via one of the East River bridges (that is, excluding Bronx thruways and the non-bikeable Hudson River tunnels) for a stretch of 9 months.

Content:-

A count of the number of bicycles on each of the bridges in question is provided on a day-by-day basis, along with information on maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation.

Acknowledgements:-

New York City - East River Bicycle Crossings is a open source dataset on Kaggle. It was published by The New York City Department of Transportation on a sample size of 9months. Which consist of 210 days of data and consist of 3 parameters. Mainly High Temperature, Low Temperature & precipitation.

Inspiration:-

1. Which day in the whole nine months has maximum ridership attained?
2. Which day in the whole nine months has minimum ridership attained?
3. To find the Average bicycle riders crossing all four bridges everyday.
4. To understand the relationship between temperature and ridership volume and how this relationship affects our dataset.
5. To design a prediction model based on the linear regression to predict the future volume.

Methodology:-

* We have four bridges in our dataset, Brooklyn Bridge	Manhattan Bridge	Williamsburg Bridge	Queensboro Bridge.
* As a part of Exploratory Data Analysis we will comapare all four Bridges individually with the all three parameters. Which will create a broad understanding about our dataframe.
* For the Prediction model:-
We have use the dataframe in such a way by which we will achieve a linear relation. For attaining it we take High Temperature and Total riders all day as our data.

Observations:-
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
* Brooklyn Bridge:-
